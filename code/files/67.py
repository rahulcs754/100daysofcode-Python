# A simple Python program to demonstrate 
# working of iterators using an example type 
# that iterates from 10 to given value 

# An iterable user defined type 
class Test: 

	# Cosntructor 
	def __init__(self, limit): 
		self.limit = limit 

	# Called when iteration is initialized 
	def __iter__(self): 
		self.x = 10
		return self

	# To move to next element. In Python 3, 
	# we should replace next with __next__ 
	def next(self): 

		# Store current value ofx 
		x = self.x 

		# Stop iteration if limit is reached 
		if x > self.limit: 
			raise StopIteration 

		# Else increment and return old value 
		self.x = x + 1; 
		return x 

# Prints numbers from 10 to 15 
for i in Test(15):

# Prints nothing 
for i in Test(5):
